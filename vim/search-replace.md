# Search and replace on Vim

See https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace

## Basic search and replace

The `:substitute` command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. There are many options, but these are what you probably want:

* `:s/foo/bar/g`
    Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.

* `:%s/foo/bar/g`
    Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.

* `:%s/foo/bar/gc`
    Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

* `:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc`
    Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

* `:%s/foo/bar/gci`
    Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
    :%s/foo\c/bar/gc is the same because \c makes the search case insensitive.
    This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).

* `:%s/foo/bar/gcI`
    Change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
    :%s/foo\C/bar/gc is the same because \C makes the search case sensitive.
    This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive.
